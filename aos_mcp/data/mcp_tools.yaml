         - `show virtual-chassis topology`: Provide a detailed status of the virtual chassis topology.
         - `show running-directory`: Displays the running configuration status, certify/restore status, synchronization status of Chassis Management Module (CMM).
         - `show vlan <vlanid>`: Displays VLAN information for the switch. if <vlanid> parameter is present, displays information for a specific VLAN otherwise display all vlans.
         - `show vlan <vlanid> members`: Displays VLAN port associations (VPAs) for all VLANs or a specific VLAN if <vlanid> parameter is present, for all ports. 
         - `show vlan <vlanid> members port <portid>`: Displays VLAN port associations (VPAs) for all VLANs, a specific VLAN if <vlanid> parameter is present  , for a specific port with parameter <portid> as format chassis/slot/port . 
         - `show ip routes`: Displays the IP routing table.
         - `show ip interface`: Displays the configuration and status of IP interfaces.
         - `show hardware-info`: Display hardware information for cpu, ram, flash, u-boot version.

         - `show linkagg`: Displays information about static and dynamic (LACP) aggregate groups.
         - `ping <addr>`: Tests whether an IP destination can be reached from the local switch. This command sends an ICMP echo request to a destination and then waits for a reply. To ping a destination, enter the ping command and enter either the IP address or hostname of the destination. <addr> is hostname or IP address parameter to ping.
         - `traceroute <addr> timeout 2`: Traces the route to a destination IP address or hostname. This command sends a series of ICMP echo requests to the destination and then waits for replies. The command displays the IP address of each hop along the route to the destination. <addr> is hostname or IP address parameter to traceroute.
         - `show interfaces <port>`: Displays the switch interfaces. Optional parameter <port> is the port to display, in format chassis/slot/port.
