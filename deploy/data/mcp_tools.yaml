         - `show vlan <vlanid> members`: Displays VLAN port associations (VPAs) for all VLANs or a specific VLAN if <vlanid> parameter is present, for all ports. 
         - `show vlan <vlanid> members port <portid>`: Displays VLAN port associations (VPAs) for all VLANs, a specific VLAN if <vlanid> parameter is present  , for a specific port with parameter <portid> as format chassis/slot/port .
